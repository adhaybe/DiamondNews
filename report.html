      <h1>Introduction:</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">My website is a magazine style website that offers different types of news articles for four different topics such as Business news for the latest news in the market, Technology news for updates on the latest technology available, Sports news such as transfer updates and match facts. It also showcases breaking news such as world news which brings you the news coverage that is important all around the world.</h5>
        <h3 class="w3-padding-32">Three things which inspired me when creating my website:</h4>


        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">1: What inspired me to add news cards to my website was looking into Sky news because it made excellent use of it which it made it's website look more appealing to me as the user. Which is why I decided to add news cards to website.</h4>
        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">2: Adding a comments section to my news website was inspired by the blog templates I was looking into as this will allow the user's to voice their opinions and engage more directly with the website.</h4>
        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">3: Adding an slideshow to my website was inspired by how so many magazine templates used a slideshow to make their news articles seem more aesthetically appealing and as a result attracted more and more users to their website.</h4>


        <h3 class="w3-padding-32">Three things which makes my website accessible:</h4>

        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">1: One way in which my website has been made accessible is that the content has been laid out in a logical order and has used suitable colours to make it look appealing to the user.</h4>
        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">2: I have also used alternative text otherwise known as alt to allow visually impaired users to read text and see other page elements</h4>
        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">3: I have also made my website responsive meaning that it can be more accessible for user's mobile device meaning that if the site were not to be responsive it would be difficult for the user to navigate across the website because of it.</h4>

        <h3 class="w3-padding-32">Three things which I had to learn/find out myself when creating my website:</h4>


        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">1: The first thing I had to find out myself was how to implement a navigation bar using JS which allowed me to make the website look more appealing as when you scroll down the navigation bar changes it's colour. I had to look into YouTube tutorials on how to implement the navigation bar which aided the progression of my website.</h4>
        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">2: I also had to find out how to implement a slideshow in my website from W3schools and implementing into my website was a bit difficult because I had no previous knowledge of positioning a slideshow in my website because of this adding a slideshow and making it responsive was what I learned from this.</h4>
        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">3: I learned that also you do not need to use the CSS code from another website instead you could just take the link to it which allowed me to organise my code and use less CSS code.</h4>

        <h3 class="w3-padding-32">Which aspects of my website worked well and why?</h4>
        
        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">The first aspect of my website that works well is the navigation bar. This is because of the fact that the navigation bar uses JS and CSS instead of purely using CSS coding. Furthermore adding a subscription option made the website look more like a magazine newsletter website which I believe worked well with the magazine style website I implemented.</h4>

        <h3 class="w3-padding-32">What aspects of my work could be improved and what could I do differently next time?</h3>

        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">What I could do differently next time would be is that I would implement more animations to my website as well make the slideshow more advanced. Furthermore, what I could also do to improve the website would be to add a better slideshow in the home page which showcases all four genres of news at the same time for the user which will enhance the design of the website. I could also add videos to my website which would also make it more interesting instead reading through numerous amounts of information. This is because videos will make the content more engaging for the user and having higher quality videos will allow you to attract more users to your website.</h4>

        <h3 class="w3-padding-32">Adaptation of source code used</h3>

        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">Navigation bar:</h4>

        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">When creating my navigation bar Sticky JS Navbar I adapted the existing source code by adding an hover effect to it from another source code and also removing the active login from it has been redesigned to enhance the design of my website. This made the navigation bar looking more aesthetically appealing.</h5>

        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">Blog web template:</h4>

        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The blog template was used as a necessary sample because it fitted the design most magazine style news websites have and was adapted by added another footer to it from another source code as well as adding relevent sample content from news websites to transform it into a news website.</h5>

        <h4 class="w3-padding-32">Footer:</h4>

        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The footer was taken directly from the source the code and was slightly adapted eg adding own links to it to make it relevant to the website.</h5>
